-- How to become better at machine learning? -- I asked one of the top kaggler.  
-- Try implementing machine algorithms from scratch. -- he said.

So here I go.

Machine learning algorithms in Scala done for educational purposes.

Done so far
===

* Linear regression
    * Closed-form solution
    * Gradient descent (vectorized solution)
    * Gradient descent (non-vectorized solution)
    * Stochastic gradient descent
* Logistic regression

Next in todo: Neural networks
====

* Perceptron
* Multilayer perceptron
* Convolutional Neural Networks
